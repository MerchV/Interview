# Interview
Code sample for interviews.


This is a work in progress and not complete.

This project is intended to be viewed by companies interested in interviewing me for iOS development roles. 

This project demonstrates a standard app that displays and updates connect from a JSON API. As such, it demonstrates the following common techniques:

- Networking using _URLSession._

- Persistence using _Core Data._

- Multithreading using _OperationQueue._ 

- Custom screen transitions using _UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning._ 

- Unit testing using _XCTestCase._

The app is not intended to look good, as that would require graphical design consideration.

This app connects to a JSON API written by myself running on Java Servlets on a Tomcat server running on a VPS including a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. That's not exposed anywhere in this project since it's not part of my role as an iOS developer but server development is something I take an interest in.
