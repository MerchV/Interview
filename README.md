# Interview
Code sample for interviews.


This is a work in progress and not complete.

This project is intended to be viewed by companies interested in interviewing me for iOS development roles. 

This project demonstrates the following techniques:

Networking using URLSession.

Persistence using Core Data.

Multithreading using OperationQueue. 

The app is not intended to look good, because that would require graphical design consideration.
